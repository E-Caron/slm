\title{Data-driven spectral density estimation}
\usage{
cov_spectralproj(epsilon, model_selec = -1,
 model_max = min(100,length(epsilon)/2), plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{epsilon}{an univariate process.}

\item{model_selec}{the dimension of the method. If \code{model_selec = -1}, the method works automatically and take a dimension between 1 and \code{model_max}.}

\item{model_max}{the maximal dimension. By default, it is equal to the minimum between 100 and the length of the process divided by 2.}

\item{plot}{logical. By default, \code{plot = FALSE}. If \code{plot = TRUE}, plot the spectral density estimator of the process.}
}
\value{
The function returns the estimated autocovariances of the process, that is the Fourier coefficients
 of the spectral density estimates, and the dimension chosen by the algorithm.
 \item{model_selec}{the dimension selected.}
 \item{cov_st}{the estimated autocovariances.}
}
\description{
Computes a data-driven histogram estimator of the spectral density of a process and compute its Fourier coefficients,
 that is the associated autocovariances. For a dimension \eqn{d}, the estimator of the spectral density is an histogram on a regular basis of
 size \eqn{d}. Then we use a penalized criterion in order to choose the dimension which balance the bias and the variance, as proposed in Comte (2001). The penalty
 is of the form \eqn{c*d/n}, where \eqn{c} is the constant and \eqn{n} the sample size. The dimension and the constant of the penalty are
 chosen with the slope heuristic method, with the dimension jump algorithm (from package "\code{\link[capushe:capushe]{capushe}}").
